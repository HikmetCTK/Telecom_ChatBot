# Telecom_ChatBot
Telecommunication Chatbot for providing tasks based on customer inputs.

The Telecom Chatbot is an AI-powered conversational agent designed to assist and understand intent of users with telecommunications-related queries. The chatbot can answer questions about remaining phone tariff rights,
switching to a new tariff, connecting to a customer representative and the current tariff price

I used Gemini 1.5-flash model which is powerful and fast model of Google.

I used Few-Shot prompting technique which  helps my chatbot to understand its limitations  and communicating friendly with customers
